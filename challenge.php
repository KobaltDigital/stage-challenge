Here is a list of everyone you can find at the Kobalt office:
Arne
Reinier
Kylian
Huub
Mick
Brenda
Ruben
Desley
Carly
Esther

The challenge:
01: Sort the list.
02: Calculate the alphabetic value of each name. (a=1, b=2, ..., z=26)
03: Multiply this value with the position in the sorted list. (first position = x 1, second position = x 2)

Example:
Apple
Banana

Apple = 1 + 16 + 16 + 12 + 5 = 50
Banana = 2 + 1 + 14 + 1 + 14 + 1 = 33

Total score = 50 x 1 + 33 x 2 = 116

The results:
What is the total score?

Requirements:
- Make an estimate of the time you need to complete the challenge.
- Make the challenge in Laravel. We will take a look at the total score, but also at the quality of your code.
- Make use of the database, the routes, models, controllers and views. Maybe even a form that you can submit.
- Upload your code to GitHub.
- Send a link to hello@kobaltdigital.nl with the actual time it took and why it took longer or shorter than your estimated time.

Bonus points:
- Commit frequently.
- Tell us what you think of this challenge! #tipsarewelcome
